            <p>
              Born and brought up in India, I studied Mechatronics engineering
              in school because I believed it would give me the broadest
              introduction to how things are built. Joined an IT company to
              learn how things are built on the internet. Shifted to working at
              the intersection of design and engineering, to explore what I felt
              passionate about. And finally went to school in Italy when I
              realized that design was my true calling.
            </p>
            <p>
              To me, design is far more than aesthetics or utility; it's a deep
              understanding of a domain and its community. By immersing myself
              in these complex environments, I aim to gain insights about
              motives, goals, and context that shape acitivites in a domain.
              This holistic understanding allows me to systematically design
              solutions that integrate into people's lives addressing addressing
              their needs, motivations, among other factors that influence their
              interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a diverse portfolio spanning multiple complex domains, I have
              honed the ability to quickly learn about these environments,
              distilling insights to enable cross-functional collaboration and
              innovation. I bring a strategic, collaborative, critical thinking
              approach and mindset to achieve team and business objectives by
              creating solutions that resonate with people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Design empowers me to express the change I want to see in the
              world â€” and work with people and teams attempting to do the same.
