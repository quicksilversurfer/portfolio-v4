              Ultrasound devices
            </a>{" "}
            are a cornerstone of modern medical imaging, offering a non-invasive
            and versatile tool for various clinical purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary user group consists of sonographers, who operate the
            devices to capture diagnostic images, but physicians, particularly
            in Europe and Asia, also frequently utilize ultrasound technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            These devices, while invaluable in healthcare, present complex
            interfaces with multiple interaction points, including control
            panels with hardware knobs and buttons, touchscreens for secondary
            functions, and trackballs for navigating the main monitor.
          </p>
          <p>Within ultrasound imaging, there are two main specializations:</p>
          <ul className="list-outside pl-4 space-y-4">
            <li className="list-disc pl-2">
              <b className="font-semibold">General Imaging:</b> This
              specialization focuses on overall imaging of the body and
              encompasses a wide range of examinations, making it the most
              common type of ultrasound system used in healthcare facilities.
            </li>
            <li className="list-disc pl-2">
              <b className="font-semibold">Cardiology:</b> This specialization
              focuses specifically on imaging the heart, requiring additional
              considerations for capturing and analyzing the motion of a beating
              heart.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Major manufacturers produce dedicated versions of ultrasound systems
            for both specialties. While much of the core functionality is
            similar, the key difference lies in the approach to imaging static
            organs versus dynamic structures like the heart.

            During my internship at Siemens Healthineers, under the guidance of
            UX designers Emin Sinani and Xinran Fan, I joined the team as they
            embarked on the preliminary research and concept development for the
            ACUSON Sequoia. My contributions focused on supporting the team in
            exploring a wide range of design concepts and building functional
            prototypes to test and validate ideas with sonographers.

            While some novel touchscreen concepts were well-received, project
            management opted for a more conservative approach to maintain
            familiarity for users accustomed to traditional ultrasound systems.

            As the Sequoia project progressed, I was entrusted with the
            responsibility of leading the design of the ACUSON Origin, the
            cardiology-specific ultrasound device (a successor to the SC2000
            PRIME ultrasound system).
          </p>
          <p>
            This presented an exciting opportunity to drive the transformation
            of a critical medical device, but also came with the immense
            challenge of completing the redesign and testing within a tight
            timeframe of 1.5 years and a budget exceeding $500,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the key hurdles was the need to "leapfrog" a generation,
            transitioning from a legacy system without a touchscreen interface
            to a modern, partially digital platform. This required us to re-map
            the entire hardware control panel feature set onto a new interaction
            framework.

            the project from start to finish.
          </p>
          <p>
            To tackle this complex undertaking, I implemented a highly iterative
            approach that involved simultaneous discovery and definition phases.
            This allowed us to leverage existing knowledge about cardiology
            workflows from previous research, utilize control panel frameworks
            established during the Sequoia project, and incorporate both concept
            evaluations and contextual inquiries into each iteration.

            During the primary research phase, we dedicated significant effort

            While the Sequoia team had initially decided to move forward with
            the trackpad for its modern design and cleanability, our growing
            familiarity with the nuances of cardiology workflows raised concerns
            about its effectiveness.

          <p>
            Cardiology examinations often involve drawing numerous precise
            measurements on images, such as diameter measurements and trace
            measurements to calculate volumes for assessing heart function. We
            suspected that the trackpad might hinder user accuracy and
            efficiency compared to the traditional trackball, despite its
            perceived outdated design.

            The results of our study confirmed our initial concerns about the
            trackpad's suitability for cardiology workflows. The trackpad proved
            to be significantly slower than the trackball in terms of movement
            time, and users made considerably more errors when using it.

        <Block title="Key Takeaways">
          <h4 className="uppercase text-sm">The Power of User-Centricity</h4>
          <p>
            The success of both the ACUSON Sequoia and ACUSON Origin projects
            underscores the importance of a user-centered design approach. By
            consistently prioritizing user needs, conducting thorough research,
            and incorporating user feedback throughout the design process, we
            were able to create systems that resonated with healthcare
            professionals and delivered a truly valuable and efficient user
            experience.
          </p>
          <h4 className="uppercase text-sm pt-4">
            Leveraging Organizational Expertise
          </h4>
          <p>
            Tapping into the collective wisdom and expertise across various
            teams and departments within the organization was crucial to
            informing and elevating the design direction. Collaboration with
            human factor engineers, product managers, clinical specialists, and
            marketing teams ensured that our solutions were not only
            user-friendly but also aligned with technical feasibility, market
            demands, and business goals.
          </p>
          <h4 className="uppercase text-sm pt-4">Adaptability and Iteration</h4>
          <p>
            Navigating the complexities of designing next-generation ultrasound
            systems required a high degree of adaptability and an iterative
            approach. We continuously refined our designs based on user research
            findings, stakeholder feedback, and technological considerations.
            This flexibility allowed us to overcome challenges and ensure the
            final product met the evolving needs of the healthcare industry.

          <h4 className="uppercase text-sm pt-4">
            Evidence-Based Decision Making
          </h4>
          <p>
            Throughout the project, we emphasized making data-driven decisions
            grounded in research findings and objective evidence. This was
            particularly crucial in navigating high-stakes situations, such as
            the decision to revert to the trackball as the primary input device
            for the ACUSON Origin. By prioritizing user data over assumptions or
            personal preferences, we ensured that our design choices were based
            on a solid foundation and ultimately led to a more successful
            outcome.
          </p>
          <h4 className="uppercase text-sm pt-4">
            Compassion and Collaboration
          </h4>
          <p>
            Recognizing the diverse perspectives and challenges faced by
            teammates and stakeholders was essential for fostering successful
            collaboration. By approaching interactions with empathy and
            understanding, we were able to build strong relationships, align on
            shared goals, and navigate complex situations with greater ease.
            This collaborative spirit was instrumental in driving the project
            forward and achieving a shared vision of success.
