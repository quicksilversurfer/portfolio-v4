          <p>
            Siemens Healthineers unveiled the ACUSON Sequoia ultrasound system
            in 2018 at a launch event in Seattle. The system represented a
            significant leap forward in medical imaging technology, with its
            ability to image patients of virtually any body type—dramatically
            demonstrated by successfully scanning a 600lb sumo wrestler. This
            capability showcased key innovations including the Deep Abdominal
            Transducer for superior tissue penetration and enhanced elastography
            for detailed tissue characterization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond technical specifications, the system gained immediate
            recognition for its thoughtfully designed user interface—the
            culmination of our extensive research and human-centered design
            process. Medical professionals particularly noted how the system
            improved workflow efficiency while reducing physical strain during
            extended scanning sessions.

            What began as a straightforward design choice evolved into one of
            the project's most consequential research initiatives. During early
            concept development for the Sequoia platform, the trackpad had been
            selected as the primary input device, largely based on its modern
            aesthetic, improved cleanability in clinical environments, and
            alignment with contemporary computing trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as our team delved deeper into cardiology workflows, we
            began questioning this direction. Cardiac imaging involves uniquely
            demanding measurement tasks—tracing the borders of heart chambers to
            calculate volumes, measuring vessel diameters down to the
            millimeter, and precisely placing reference points on rapidly moving
            structures. These tasks require a level of control and precision
            that might not be achievable with a trackpad.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than proceeding on intuition alone, we recognized the need
            for objective evidence. This input device would be central to daily
            interactions with the system, directly affecting diagnostic accuracy
            and workflow efficiency. The stakes were too high to rely on
            assumptions or aesthetic preferences—we needed data to guide this
            decision.

              throughput (a combined measure of speed and accuracy), and target
              re-entry patterns. By controlling target size and distance

            The results provided unambiguous evidence that challenged our
            initial direction. The trackpad consistently underperformed compared
            to the trackball across nearly all measures:
          </p>
          <p>
            Movement times were significantly longer with the trackpad, with
            users taking on average 30% more time to complete identical pointing
            tasks. Error rates showed an even more pronounced difference, with
            nearly twice as many targeting errors when using the trackpad.
            Perhaps most concerning for clinical applications, the precision
            tasks revealed that measurements made with the trackpad showed
            greater variability—a critical issue for diagnostic accuracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The qualitative feedback reinforced these findings. While some users
            appreciated the modern feel of the trackpad, the vast
            majority—especially those with extensive clinical
            experience—expressed strong preference for the trackball when
            performing actual measurement tasks. This preference was
            particularly pronounced among participants outside the US, where

          There's no substitute for witnessing clinicians in their natural
          environment. In one German hospital, I watched a cardiologist
          seamlessly transition between three different systems while
          maintaining a conversation with the patient—a moment that crystallized
          our need to design for divided attention and multitasking. These
          observed realities shaped our interface principles far more powerfully
          than any assumption we might have made in isolation.

          <p>
            After months of international research, we now had a rich foundation
            of user insights to guide our final design direction. The challenge
            shifted from discovery to synthesis—how could we distill this wealth
            of information into a physical interface that would serve
            cardiologists across different regions, specialties, and experience
            levels?
          </p>
          <p>
            We recognized that the relationship between physical controls and
            touchscreen elements would be critical. The hardware needed to
            provide immediate access to primary functions while the touchscreen
            would complement these controls with contextual options and
            secondary features. This hybrid approach would allow us to simplify
            the physical interface without sacrificing functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            To validate our synthesis, I designed a final evaluation study
            focused on three refined control panel concepts. Each represented a
            different balance of physical controls and touchscreen integration,
            with variations in key placement, grouping logic, and interaction
            flow. We tested specific elements that previous research had
            identified as crucial: dual controls for simultaneous adjustments,
            Tissue Equalization placement, capture key accessibility, annotation
            tools, and the logical organization of imaging modes that matched
            mental models of the examination sequence.

            As the physical control panel took shape, we simultaneously
            conducted research to define its touchscreen counterpart. The
            touchscreen needed to serve as both an extension of the physical
            controls and an adaptive interface that could transform based on
            context. Our approach included:

              We conducted structured card sorting exercises where cardiologists
              organized and grouped functions based on their workflow
              priorities. This revealed natural clustering patterns that
              informed our information architecture and helped distinguish which
              functions deserved physical controls versus touchscreen placement.

              <b className="font-semibold">Progressive disclosure strategy: </b>{" "}
              Through iterative testing, we developed a layered approach to the
              touchscreen interface where primary functions appeared immediately
              while specialized tools remained accessible but didn't create
              visual clutter. This approach received particularly positive
              feedback from new users who appreciated the reduced cognitive
              load.

              <b className="font-semibold">Contextual adaptation patterns:</b>{" "}
              We designed and tested different models for how the touchscreen
              should adapt throughout the examination workflow. We found that
              users strongly preferred a consistent structural framework with
              contextual content changes rather than complete layout shifts
              between modes.

            The final validation studies provided clear direction, with one
            control panel concept emerging as significantly preferred across
            user groups. This concept featured a streamlined layout with
            approximately 30% fewer physical controls than previous generation
            systems, with carefully selected primary functions promoted to
            hardware buttons while secondary functions were elegantly organized
            within the touchscreen interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            What made this design successful wasn't just the reduction in
            complexity—it was the thoughtful integration of physical and digital
            elements into a cohesive system. Functions weren't simply moved to
            the touchscreen; they were reconceived as part of an integrated
            workflow where physical controls handled primary tasks while the
            touchscreen provided contextual options, visual feedback, and
            secondary functions. This hybrid approach maintained the tactile

            For well-functioning core features, we maintained familiar

            problematic areas identified in research, we undertook more
            substantial redesigns. Throughout this process, we balanced clinical

          When a sonographer told us they could move between our systems without
          thinking about the interface, I knew we'd succeeded. The value wasn't
          in visual consistency—it was in removing cognitive friction so
          clinicians could focus entirely on their patients instead of the
          technology.

          <p>
            Design theories and assumptions require real-world validation. As
            our concepts evolved from rough sketches to functional prototypes,
            we implemented a series of formative evaluations to assess how well
            our designs matched the mental models and expectations of actual
            users in clinical contexts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I designed these evaluations to take place at key development
            milestones, using increasingly refined prototypes that simulated
            core interactions. Conducting sessions in both the US and Germany
            ensured we captured perspectives from different clinical traditions
            and regional workflows. Our testing framework focused on three
            critical objectives:

            As the project evolved, our evaluation approach adapted as well.
            While I led the initial rounds of testing, focusing on foundational
            interface concepts and primary workflows, my colleague Aishwarya
            Suresh took point on two subsequent evaluations that examined more
            specialized features and refinements. This transition allowed me to
            focus on implementing design changes and advancing the visual
            language of the system while maintaining our commitment to
            user-centered validation.

            Each evaluation cycle yielded both quantitative metrics and
            qualitative insights that directly shaped our design decisions.
            Patterns emerged across user sessions that highlighted areas for
            improvement:
          </p>
          <p>
            We discovered that sonographers consistently reached for certain
            controls with their non-dominant hand while holding the transducer,
            informing our repositioning of frequently used functions.
            Observation revealed that many users struggled with multi-level
            menus during active scanning, leading us to flatten hierarchies for
            critical functions. User feedback also confirmed the value of
            customization options that we had debated internally, showing that
            different clinical specialties had distinct preferences for
            workspace organization.

          <p>
            To objectively measure our progress, we employed the System
            Usability Scale (SUS) at each evaluation milestone. This
            standardized assessment provided a consistent benchmark that allowed
            us to track improvements across iterations. We were pleased to see
            our scores consistently reaching 80 and above—well into the
            "excellent" range for medical devices and significantly higher than
            industry averages for comparable systems.

            After completing two comprehensive evaluation cycles that validated
            our core design approach, the Ultrasound team made a strategic
            decision to temporarily shift resources toward finalizing the
            Sequoia platform for market release. This reprioritization meant
            pausing further Origin development while we focused on bringing
            Sequoia to completion.
          </p>
          <p>
            I transitioned to supporting the Sequoia team during this period,
            applying insights from our Origin research to enhance several
            critical features. The reporting workflow in particular benefited
            from our findings about information organization and visualization
            preferences. This cross-pollination proved valuable for both
            projects—Sequoia gained refined interfaces informed by our extensive
            cardiology research, while the Origin design remained aligned with
            its sibling platform, ensuring consistency across the product
            family.
          </p>
          <p>
            This adaptation demonstrated the value of our systematic design
            approach. Because we had developed comprehensive documentation and
            established clear design principles, our work remained relevant and
            ready to resume when priorities shifted back to the Origin platform.

          matter and fixed the things that always frustrated me." This simple
          observation highlighted what I believe is the essence of thoughtful
          redesign—respecting the wisdom embedded in existing workflows while
          finding opportunities to reduce friction and complexity. It's not
