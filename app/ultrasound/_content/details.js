            stand as essential tools in modern medicine, providing clinicians
            with real-time visualization of internal structures without
            radiation or invasive procedures. Their versatility spans from
            routine prenatal checkups to complex cardiac assessments, making
            them indispensable across healthcare settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary users of these systems are sonographers—specialized
            technicians who develop remarkable dexterity and spatial reasoning
            skills through years of training. Regional variations in practice
            emerge across different healthcare systems, with physicians in
            Europe and Asia often operating the devices directly, while in North
            America, the workflow typically involves sonographers capturing
            images for physician interpretation.
          </p>
          <p>
            What makes ultrasound particularly challenging from a design
            perspective is its complex interaction model. Users must
            simultaneously position a physical probe on a patient's body while
            manipulating controls and interpreting real-time images. This
            creates a distinctly demanding environment where cognitive load is
            high and attention is divided across multiple focal points—the
            control panel with its array of knobs and buttons, touchscreens
            housing secondary functions, trackballs for navigation, and of
            course, the main display showing the ultrasound image.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within this field, two primary specializations shape how systems are
            designed and used:

              widespread application, encompassing examinations of abdominal
              organs, musculoskeletal structures, vascular systems, and
              obstetrics. These systems require flexibility to accommodate
              diverse imaging protocols while maintaining consistent usability
              across varying contexts. The workflow often involves capturing
              static images of relatively stable structures.

              visualizing a rapidly moving organ with complex chambers and
              valves. The workflow includes capturing both static images and
              motion sequences (cine loops), requiring specialized controls and

            while honoring the specialized needs of each domain. Understanding
            these nuanced differences became fundamental to our approach,
            allowing us to identify opportunities for standardization while
            respecting the specialized workflows that had evolved in each field.

            Creating next-generation ultrasound systems presented a multifaceted
            challenge: how to advance the technical capabilities while making
            them more accessible to a diverse range of healthcare professionals.
            Beneath this broad objective lay several specific challenges that
            shaped our approach:

              </b>{" "}
              The reality of healthcare facilities increasingly relying on
              traveling sonographers meant our systems needed to support users
              with varying backgrounds and experience levels. A novice
              technician might encounter our system on their first day of a
              short-term assignment, with limited time for training.
              Simultaneously, the interface needed to satisfy experienced
              professionals who demand efficient workflows and advanced
              capabilities. This spectrum of expertise required thoughtful
              progressive disclosure—making basic functions immediately clear
              while allowing access to sophisticated features.

                Standardizing and simplifying interfaces:
              </b>{" "}
              Previous generations of ultrasound systems had evolved
              organically, often adding controls and features without
              reconsidering the overall interface architecture. The result was
              control panels with upwards of 70 physical buttons and complex
              menu structures that buried important functions. Our challenge was
              to rigorously evaluate which controls truly needed dedicated
              physical presence, which could be contextually presented on a
              touchscreen, and how to organize them in a way that matched users'
              mental models of the examination process.

                Facilitating adaptability and seamless transitions:
              </b>{" "}
              Healthcare environments are rarely homogeneous—facilities often
              operate multiple systems from different manufacturers and
              generations. Our research revealed that sonographers might use
              three different ultrasound systems in a single day, each with its
              own interface logic. This context switching creates cognitive
              burden and increases the potential for errors. We needed to create
              interfaces that felt intuitive to users coming from competitor
              systems while establishing a consistent pattern language that
              could extend across our entire product line, reducing the learning
              curve when transitioning between Siemens Healthineers devices.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These challenges were further complicated by the critical nature of
            ultrasound examinations. Unlike consumer products where minor
            usability issues might cause momentary frustration, in medical
            contexts they can impact diagnostic accuracy and patient care. Every
            design decision needed to balance innovation with reliability, and
            simplicity with necessary depth of functionality.

          The brief from project management was deceptively straightforward:
          meet or beat competitor workflow, and significantly improve walk-up

          transforming highly sophisticated medical devices into tools that felt

            During my internship at Siemens Healthineers, I joined UX designers
            Emin Sinani and Xinran Fan as they began the foundational work that
            would shape the ACUSON Sequoia. Rather than simply inheriting
            previous design patterns, the team approached this as an opportunity
            to question fundamental assumptions about ultrasound interfaces and
            how they might better serve users.
          </p>
          <p>
            My contributions centered on expanding the exploration space—helping
            to develop and test a spectrum of design concepts ranging from
            evolutionary refinements to more revolutionary approaches. Through
            this process, we identified several key directions that would guide
            the platform's development:

              Traditional ultrasound systems featured upwards of 70 physical
              controls, creating a visually overwhelming interface for new
              users. By carefully analyzing which functions truly needed
              dedicated physical controls versus those that could be
              contextually presented, we created concepts that significantly
              streamlined the panel while preserving critical functionality.

              The trackball had been a staple of ultrasound systems for decades,
              but came with maintenance challenges and an increasingly dated
              feel. We developed prototypes using trackpads as an alternative,
              hypothesizing that they might offer better cleanability in
              clinical environments while providing a more contemporary
              interaction model familiar to users of modern computing devices.

              Ultrasound systems had developed through accretion—new features

              organization. By mapping existing controls, identifying logical
              groupings, and testing different organizational schemas, we aimed
              to create a more intuitive framework that would reduce cognitive
              load during scanning procedures.

            To move beyond theoretical concepts and gather meaningful user
            feedback, we needed to create experiences that sonographers could
            actually interact with. I contributed to developing functional
            prototypes using Flash, Processing, and Java—each technology

            The user evaluations revealed interesting tensions between
            innovation and continuity. While sonographers consistently supported
            reducing the number of physical controls, preferences varied
            regarding how radically to reimagine the interface. This led to
            thoughtful discussions about balancing novel approaches with the
            realities of clinical environments where training time is limited
            and workflow disruptions can impact patient care.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trackpad concept exemplified this tension. Though some users
            appreciated its modern feel and potential hygiene benefits, others
            expressed concerns about precision for measurements and adaptability
            for sonographers with decades of trackball experience. This mixed
            feedback highlighted the importance of rigorous validation before
            committing to such a fundamental change in the interaction model—a

          <p>
            Beyond individual controls and input devices, we needed to address
            the underlying system organization. I worked on analyzing and
            mapping the complex information architecture—identifying patterns,
            redundancies, and opportunities for simplification. This involved
            categorizing functions based on frequency of use, workflow stage,
            and logical relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
            By exploring different interface paradigms—from toggle buttons to
            contextual menus to stepped controls—we developed a framework that
            would guide the organization of functions across both hardware and
            software interfaces. This foundational work established principles
            that would inform not just the Sequoia platform but subsequent
            systems as well, creating a more consistent and intuitive experience
            across the product line.

          <p>
            As the Sequoia project progressed, I was entrusted with the
            responsibility of leading the design of the ACUSON Origin, the
            cardiology-specific ultrasound device (a successor to the SC2000
            PRIME ultrasound system).
          </p>
          <p>
            This presented an exciting opportunity to drive the transformation
            of a critical medical device, but also came with the immense
            challenge of completing the redesign and testing within a tight
            timeframe of 1.5 years and a budget exceeding $500,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the key hurdles was the need to "leapfrog" a generation,
            transitioning from a legacy system without a touchscreen interface
            to a modern, partially digital platform. This required us to re-map
            the entire hardware control panel feature set onto a new interaction
            framework.

            coordinating cross-functional teams, and overseeing the execution of
            the project from start to finish.
          </p>
          <p>
            To tackle this complex undertaking, I implemented a highly iterative
            approach that involved simultaneous discovery and definition phases.
            This allowed us to leverage existing knowledge about cardiology
            workflows from previous research, utilize control panel frameworks
            established during the Sequoia project, and incorporate both concept
            evaluations and contextual inquiries into each iteration.

            The foundational work of secondary research and internal validation

            What began as a straightforward design choice evolved into one of
            the project's most consequential research initiatives. During early
            concept development for the Sequoia platform, the trackpad had been
            selected as the primary input device, largely based on its modern
            aesthetic, improved cleanability in clinical environments, and
            alignment with contemporary computing trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as our team delved deeper into cardiology workflows, we
            began questioning this direction. Cardiac imaging involves uniquely
            demanding measurement tasks—tracing the borders of heart chambers to
            calculate volumes, measuring vessel diameters down to the
            millimeter, and precisely placing reference points on rapidly moving
            structures. These tasks require a level of control and precision
            that might not be achievable with a trackpad.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than proceeding on intuition alone, we recognized the need
            for objective evidence. This input device would be central to daily
            interactions with the system, directly affecting diagnostic accuracy
            and workflow efficiency. The stakes were too high to rely on
            assumptions or aesthetic preferences—we needed data to guide this
            decision.

              throughput (a combined measure of speed and accuracy), and target
              re-entry patterns. By controlling target size and distance

            The results provided unambiguous evidence that challenged our
            initial direction. The trackpad consistently underperformed compared
            to the trackball across nearly all measures:
          </p>
          <p>
            Movement times were significantly longer with the trackpad, with
            users taking on average 30% more time to complete identical pointing
            tasks. Error rates showed an even more pronounced difference, with
            nearly twice as many targeting errors when using the trackpad.
            Perhaps most concerning for clinical applications, the precision
            tasks revealed that measurements made with the trackpad showed
            greater variability—a critical issue for diagnostic accuracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The qualitative feedback reinforced these findings. While some users
            appreciated the modern feel of the trackpad, the vast
            majority—especially those with extensive clinical
            experience—expressed strong preference for the trackball when
            performing actual measurement tasks. This preference was
            particularly pronounced among participants outside the US, where
            trackpads were less common in clinical environments.

            direction, with investments in hardware development and marketing
            positioning around its modern interface. Our research didn't just
            suggest a slight preference—it demonstrated meaningful performance

          There's no substitute for witnessing clinicians in their natural

          seamlessly transition between three different systems while
          maintaining a conversation with the patient—a moment that crystallized
          our need to design for divided attention and multitasking. These
          observed realities shaped our interface principles far more powerfully

          <p>
            After months of international research, we now had a rich foundation
            of user insights to guide our final design direction. The challenge
            shifted from discovery to synthesis—how could we distill this wealth
            of information into a physical interface that would serve
            cardiologists across different regions, specialties, and experience
            levels?
          </p>
          <p>
            We recognized that the relationship between physical controls and
            touchscreen elements would be critical. The hardware needed to
            provide immediate access to primary functions while the touchscreen
            would complement these controls with contextual options and
            secondary features. This hybrid approach would allow us to simplify
            the physical interface without sacrificing functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            To validate our synthesis, I designed a final evaluation study
            focused on three refined control panel concepts. Each represented a
            different balance of physical controls and touchscreen integration,
            with variations in key placement, grouping logic, and interaction
            flow. We tested specific elements that previous research had
            identified as crucial: dual controls for simultaneous adjustments,
            Tissue Equalization placement, capture key accessibility, annotation
            tools, and the logical organization of imaging modes that matched
            mental models of the examination sequence.

            As the physical control panel took shape, we simultaneously
            conducted research to define its touchscreen counterpart. The
            touchscreen needed to serve as both an extension of the physical
            controls and an adaptive interface that could transform based on
            context. Our approach included:

              We conducted structured card sorting exercises where cardiologists
              organized and grouped functions based on their workflow
              priorities. This revealed natural clustering patterns that
              informed our information architecture and helped distinguish which
              functions deserved physical controls versus touchscreen placement.

              <b className="font-semibold">Progressive disclosure strategy: </b>{" "}
              Through iterative testing, we developed a layered approach to the
              touchscreen interface where primary functions appeared immediately
              while specialized tools remained accessible but didn't create
              visual clutter. This approach received particularly positive
              feedback from new users who appreciated the reduced cognitive
              load.

              <b className="font-semibold">Contextual adaptation patterns:</b>{" "}
              We designed and tested different models for how the touchscreen
              should adapt throughout the examination workflow. We found that
              users strongly preferred a consistent structural framework with
              contextual content changes rather than complete layout shifts
              between modes.

            The final validation studies provided clear direction, with one
            control panel concept emerging as significantly preferred across
            user groups. This concept featured a streamlined layout with
            approximately 30% fewer physical controls than previous generation
            systems, with carefully selected primary functions promoted to
            hardware buttons while secondary functions were elegantly organized
            within the touchscreen interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            What made this design successful wasn't just the reduction in
            complexity—it was the thoughtful integration of physical and digital
            elements into a cohesive system. Functions weren't simply moved to
            the touchscreen; they were reconceived as part of an integrated
            workflow where physical controls handled primary tasks while the
            touchscreen provided contextual options, visual feedback, and
            secondary functions. This hybrid approach maintained the tactile
            precision cardiologists required while introducing the flexibility
            and simplification benefits of digital interfaces.

          Finding the balance required more than aesthetic choices—it demanded

          The true value of our design system went beyond visual consistency. By
          creating a unified interaction language across different machines, we
          had reduced cognitive overhead for clinicians, allowing them to focus
          on patients rather than interfaces. These moments of real-world impact
          always remind me why thoughtful system design matters beyond

            Design theories and assumptions require real-world validation. As
            our concepts evolved from rough sketches to functional prototypes,
            we implemented a series of formative evaluations to assess how well
            our designs matched the mental models and expectations of actual
            users in clinical contexts.

            I designed these evaluations to take place at key development
            milestones, using increasingly refined prototypes that simulated
            core interactions. Conducting sessions in both the US and Germany
            ensured we captured perspectives from different clinical traditions
            and regional workflows. Our testing framework focused on three
            critical objectives:

            While I led the initial rounds of testing, focusing on foundational
            interface concepts and primary workflows, my colleague Aishwarya
            Suresh took point on two subsequent evaluations that examined more
            specialized features and refinements. This transition allowed me to
            focus on implementing design changes and advancing the visual
            language of the system while maintaining our commitment to
            user-centered validation.

            Each evaluation cycle yielded both quantitative metrics and
            qualitative insights that directly shaped our design decisions.
            Patterns emerged across user sessions that highlighted areas for
            improvement:
          </p>
          <p>
            We discovered that sonographers consistently reached for certain
            controls with their non-dominant hand while holding the transducer,
            informing our repositioning of frequently used functions.
            Observation revealed that many users struggled with multi-level
            menus during active scanning, leading us to flatten hierarchies for
            critical functions. User feedback also confirmed the value of
            customization options that we had debated internally, showing that
            different clinical specialties had distinct preferences for
            workspace organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            To objectively measure our progress, we employed the System
            Usability Scale (SUS) at each evaluation milestone. This
            standardized assessment provided a consistent benchmark that allowed
            us to track improvements across iterations. We were pleased to see
            our scores consistently reaching 80 and above—well into the
            "excellent" range for medical devices and significantly higher than
            industry averages for comparable systems.

            After completing two comprehensive evaluation cycles that validated
            our core design approach, the Ultrasound team made a strategic
            decision to temporarily shift resources toward finalizing the
            Sequoia platform for market release. This reprioritization meant
            pausing further Origin development while we focused on bringing
            Sequoia to completion.
          </p>
          <p>
            I transitioned to supporting the Sequoia team during this period,
            applying insights from our Origin research to enhance several
            critical features. The reporting workflow in particular benefited
            from our findings about information organization and visualization
            preferences. This cross-pollination proved valuable for both
            projects—Sequoia gained refined interfaces informed by our extensive
            cardiology research, while the Origin design remained aligned with
            its sibling platform, ensuring consistency across the product
            family.
          </p>
          <p>
            This adaptation demonstrated the value of our systematic design
            approach. Because we had developed comprehensive documentation and
            established clear design principles, our work remained relevant and
            ready to resume when priorities shifted back to the Origin platform.

          During one evaluation session, I watched a sonographer rapidly adapt
          to our new interface despite having spent decades on the previous
          system. When I asked about this, she replied, "You kept the parts that
          matter and fixed the things that always frustrated me." This simple
          observation highlighted what I believe is the essence of thoughtful
          redesign—respecting the wisdom embedded in existing workflows while
          finding opportunities to reduce friction and complexity. It's not
          about technological novelty, but about understanding the deeper

          The validation studies confirmed what we hoped to achieve with these
          systems. Beyond the metrics and market success, it was particularly
          rewarding to hear from clinicians about how the interfaces actually
          improved their daily practice—reducing fatigue during long procedures
          and letting them focus more on patients than on operating the
          equipment. These real-world outcomes underscore the value of our
          research-driven approach to medical device design.

          <p>
            The success of both the ACUSON Sequoia and ACUSON Origin projects
            underscores the importance of a user-centered design approach. By
            consistently prioritizing user needs, conducting thorough research,
            and incorporating user feedback throughout the design process, we
            were able to create systems that resonated with healthcare
            professionals and delivered a truly valuable and efficient user
            experience.
