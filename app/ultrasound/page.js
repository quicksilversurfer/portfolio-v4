          <Block title="ACUSON Sequoia: Role & contributions">
            <p>
              My involvement in the ACUSON Sequoia project began in the early
              research and concept exploration phase. During this time, we
              explored a wide range of design concepts, from incremental
              improvements to radical redesigns of the user interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              I contributed to building functional prototypes using Flash,
              Processing, and Java, which allowed us to test key concepts with
              sonographers and gather valuable feedback on their preferences.
              These early prototypes explored ideas such as reducing the number
              of keys on the control panel, introducing a trackpad instead of a
              trackball, and reorganizing the information architecture based on
              user mental models. This iterative process of prototyping and user
              testing was instrumental in shaping the design direction of the
              Sequoia platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I tackled the complex challenge of analyzing the
              existing information architecture and defining intuitive methods
              for adjusting system controls, ensuring a seamless and efficient
              user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later in the project, I played a key role in maintaining
              harmonization between the Sequoia platform and the specialized
              Cardiology device (ACUSON Origin), aligning workflows,
              terminology, and visual design elements across both systems.

            <p>
              As the project lead for the ACUSON Origin alongside Aishwarya
              Suresh, I spearheaded the design and development of this
              cardiology-specific ultrasound system, playing a pivotal role in
              its transformation from concept to reality. My responsibilities
              spanned the entire project lifecycle, from planning and executing
              an extensive international user research initiative to leading the
              iterative design and refinement of the user interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user research, conducted across the USA, Germany, and China,
              involved in-depth interviews, evaluations, and site visits with
              over 40 cardiologists and sonographers. This provided us with
              invaluable insights into real-world cardiology workflows, pain
              points, and unmet needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              A key outcome of this research was the identification of potential
              usability issues with the initially proposed trackpad input
              device. Through rigorous testing and data analysis, we were able
              to demonstrate the superiority of the traditional trackball for
              precise measurements and user comfort, leading to a pivotal
              decision that impacted the entire Sequoia platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond user research, I led the iterative definition of the
              control panel, touch screen, and monitor UI through
              cross-functional workshops, formative evaluations, and continuous
              refinement based on user feedback. This collaborative process
              ensured that the final design was not only intuitive and efficient
              but also tailored to the specific workflows and preferences of
              cardiologists worldwide. The successful launch of the ACUSON
              Origin, met with praise from the medical community, is a testament
              to the impact of this user-centered design approach.
