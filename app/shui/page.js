            <p>
              When Siemens Healthineers became a separate entity in 2017, the
              design organization faced the challenge of creating a unified
              identity and user experience across its vast and diverse product
              portfolio. Years of growth and acquisitions had resulted in
              inconsistencies in visual design and user interactions, hindering
              brand recognition and user efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a core member of a small, dedicated team, we were tasked with
              scaling and developing Shui, a comprehensive design system aimed
              at harmonizing the design language for Siemens Healthineers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working collaboratively with designers, engineers, and product
              managers, we focused on establishing a robust and scalable
              foundation that could be adopted across new and existing products.
            </p>
            <p>
              This involved defining core principles, creating reusable
              components and patterns, and developing guidelines for visual
              design and interaction design. Additionally, I actively
              evangelized the design system within the company, showcasing its
              benefits and providing support to product teams during
              implementation to support seamless and progressive adoption into
              legacy product lines.
