# Hello World

Thank you for stopping by.

I'm Prateek, an Interaction Designer at AWS. I am part of Databases group where I work on designing modern, easy-to-use, easy-to-learn management consoles for various database offerings.

Previously at Siemens Healthineers, I've worked on the design of medical devices and interfaces to improve the user experience and user workflow for healthcare professionals in order to support better outcomes for patients and improve operator efficiency.

I also had the opportunity to work on the redesign of a M1 market radiology device, and also worked on creating a UI design system that spans across the entire Siemens Healthineers product portfolio.

You can find my work experience and education journey below. I'd love to hear from you and you can reach out to me at - hello@prateeksolanki.com.
